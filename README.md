-------------------------------------------------------


Based on the look of the pirate audio plugin for mopidy.

Works with Pimoroni pirate audio boards with 240*240 TFT (ST7789), as well as standalone ST7789 boards.

![Sample Image](/pics/display.jpg)

### Features.

The script will display cover art (where available) for the moode library or radio stations.

* For the moode library, embedded art will be displayed first, then folder or cover images if there is no embedded art.
* For radio stations, the moode images are used.
* If no artwork is found a default image is displayed.

Metadata displayed:
* Artist
* Album/Radio Station
* Title

Overlays with a Time bar, Volume bar and Play/Pause, Next and Volume icons to match the Pirate Audio buttons are optional.

There is also an option in config.yml to not display metadata

The script has a built in test to see if the mpd service is running. This should allow enough delay when 
used as a service. If a running mpd service is not found after around 30 seconds the script displays the following and stops.

```
   MPD not Active!
Ensure MPD is running
 Then restart script
```

**Limitations**

Metadata will only be displayed for Radio Stations and the Library.

For the `Airplay`, `Spotify`, `Bluetooth`, `Squeezelite` and `Dac Input` renderers, different backgrounds will display.

The overlay colours adjust for light and dark artwork, but can be hard to read with some artwork.

The script does not search online for artwork

### Assumptions.

**You can SSH into your RPI, enter commands at the shell prompt, and use the nano editor.**

**Your moode installation works and produces audio**

If your pirate audio board doesn't output anything

Choose "Pimoroni pHAT DAC" or "HiFiBerry DAC" in moode audio config

See the Installation section [**here**](https://github.com/pimoroni/pirate-audio) about gpio pin 25. 


### Preparation.

**Enable SPI pn your RPI**

see [**Configuring SPI**](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-spi)

Install these pre-requisites:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-rpi.gpio python3-spidev python3-pip python3-pil python3-numpy
sudo pip3 install mediafile
sudo pip3 install pyyaml
```
Install the TFT driver.

I have forked the Pimoroni driver and modified it to work with other ST7789 boards. Install it with the following command:

```
sudo pip3 install RPI-ST7789
```

***Ensure 'Metadata file' is turned on in Moode System Configuration***

### Install the TFT-MoodeCoverArt script

```
cd /home/pi
git clone https://github.com/rusconi/TFT-MoodeCoverArt.git
```

### Config File

The default config should work with Pirate Audio boards

The config.yml file can be edited to:

* suit different ST7789 boards
* set overlay display options
* display the text with a shadow

The comments in 'config.yml' should be self explanatory


**Make the shell scripts executable:**

```
chmod 777 *.sh
```

Test the script:

```
python3 /home/pi/TFT-MoodeCoverArt/tft_moode_coverart.py


Ctrl-c to quit
```

**If the script works, you may want to start the display at boot:**

### Install as a service.

```
cd /home/pi/TFT-MoodeCoverArt
./install_service.sh
```

Follow the prompts.

If you wish to remove the script as a service:

```
cd /home/pi/TFT-MoodeCoverArt
./remove_service.sh
```
